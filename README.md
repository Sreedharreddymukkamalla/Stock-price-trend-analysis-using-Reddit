# Stock-price-trend-analysis-using-Reddit
This project aims to identify stock market trends by analyzing Reddit data, particularly from subreddits like r/wallstreetbets. Utilizing Python, it involves collecting posts via the PRAW API, cleaning and preprocessing the text, and performing sentiment analysis using VADER to gauge public sentiment about specific stocks. Historical stock price data is retrieved from the Kaggle dataset (tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution), and the sentiment scores are merged with stock prices to analyze correlations. Visualizations are created using libraries like Matplotlib to illustrate the relationship between Reddit sentiment and stock price movements, providing insights into how online discussions may influence market trends.
